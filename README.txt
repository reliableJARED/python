My name is Jared.  This repo is a collection of random python programming I've done in my spare time.  I run Ubuntu. Outside of the standard lib. I typically use

BeautifulSoup: http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/

requests: http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/

Matplotlib and Numpy: http://scipy.org/

OpenCV (not as straight forward, you could try this link.  Although I didn't use those instructions):http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/06/22/install-opencv-3-0-and-python-2-7-on-ubuntu/
